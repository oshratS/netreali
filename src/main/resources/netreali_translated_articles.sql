One of the greatest unknowns in the face of the third Lebanon war, which has been heard for quite some time on the Lebanese side last month, concerns the situation of the Hezbollah organization. The defense establishment has said more than once in the last year that the Shi&#39;ite organization, which Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot called Israel&#39;s No. 1 enemy, is at a moral, leadership, political and economic low point he never knew. On the other hand, thousands of fighters and field commanders will come to the next confrontation with the IDF, not only with an accurate rocket umbrella, hundreds of UAVs and heavy mortar shells, but with invaluable operational experience and self-confidence in the Syrian civil war. One of the opposite fists, in this equation, belongs to the Golani Brigade - one of the main spearheads of the IDF&#39;s Golani Brigade. The IDF in the early days of the next campaign. A visit by Ynet in recent weeks to training the brigade in the Golan Heights has shown how much the traditional infantry movement, armored vehicle ride to the destination, has changed in favor of the armored vehicles movement, or at least that has taken on new meaning. The reason for this lies in one name: the armored personnel carrier (APC), which was integrated into all the brigade&#39;s battalions, based on the Merkava 4 tank platform and advanced technologies that make infantry part of the new war machine at the point of the green army. The IDF intends to add grenade launchers and US-made 30mm cannons to contain wall-penetrating penetrations at a 60-degree angle. and even more. This means that a room on the fifth floor can be destroyed if there are terrorists in it, and this firepower will make the NAM even more lethal, since in the foreseeable future its range will reach four to five kilometers, compared to a kilometer and a half today. The reconnaissance battalion is practicing with the NAM for a raid on the abandoned Hoshenia base in the Golan, and from a short impression it can be concluded: The sensitivity to the protection of the fighters has increased, as have the fire and technological capabilities that the infantry brings to the point of contact with the enemy. Modi&#39;in, &quot;a senior officer in the Golani Brigade told Ynet,&quot; From a tank that brings the fighters to the target, the Namar became a tool that fought for the target. There is no such thing as foreign armies because there is no such technologically advanced tool. &quot; Indeed, traveling in the NCO, which easily climbs steep side slopes and maneuvers both in difficult mountainous terrain and between buildings, is another experience. It is air conditioned and its seating is convenient for the 11 soldiers who travel there, and more importantly, the fighters can watch what is happening around them without removing their heads from the turret, by means of screens that project what is happening outside, which are documented by cameras on the sides of the Namer. The commander of the NAM is therefore authorized to operate the weapons on the vessel and to find them, and it acquires the combat techniques used in the operation of the weapon and the shielding for the force that is being dismantled. &quot;It is a different experience for the enemy and it is especially difficult if you break into a building where he is hiding with the NAMER, which is able to hit the walls with its front,&quot; the officer explained. In the past, fighters were unloaded from the armored personnel carriers a few hundred meters from the target, and then marched on foot until they were attacked and attacked, but the NMS clung to the target, spraying the machine guns and the heavy machine gun on its deck. The soldiers are practicing what Golani calls the &quot;Pini Gershon briefing,&quot; after the veteran basketball coach: The commander of the force at the base explains to the fighters in the fighters&#39; cell how to unload And from which directions to the wing and to attack the target. For the purpose of explaining, he uses an erasable board and speaks in a language that is very similar to planning an attack on the opposing team, until shooting - that is, destroying the enemy. &quot;Once the armored personnel carrier dismantles the fighters and remains to wait for them.&quot; Today the NAM is not static, but continues its own assault with the force that has dismantled and fought, covering up close ranges and also &quot;He said, adding that the development of technologies to upgrade the NAMER will not end only with weapons. The IDF is developing tablets for fighters within the NAMER as an alternative to the thick and relatively cumbersome screens through which they watch outside the vehicle. The NAM developers, some of whose production will move to the United States according to the new aid agreement with the US, are also working to add a seat to another fighter and a public address system through which they can instruct the population around the enemy to evacuate. &quot;This manned company is a rifle company that knows how to advance to the target in a combined battle between the NPOs and the fighters who have unloaded. &quot;The Golani Brigade is becoming a hybrid, with a right flanking of one battalion and parallel mechanized advance of another battalion, on the NPOs, it is not a revolution, Even when Steve Jobs designed the first iPad, he thought it was only for music. &quot; And yet, do the fighters today train and know the improved Hizbullah of today, or are preparing for the Hezbollah known seven years ago? &quot;We are updating and writing new techniques adapted to the operational task, the ground itself does not change ... I do not think our fighters at the edge will be surprised&quot; . Commander of the Golani Brigade, Colonel Shlomi Binder, said: &quot;The fighting today is more sophisticated, and a fighter and commander should be the best infantry fighters, at a level expected from sharp warriors. During combat, the fighter must think about how he is exploiting the NAM in the best possible way and how he contributes to the company battle. &quot; Did you find a mistake in the article?

The Lebanese newspaper Al-Akhbar, which is affiliated with Hezbollah, which regularly reports on such cases, this morning brought new information about Itani&#39;s investigation.

The Falkland Islands are a group of 776 islands in the Southwest Atlantic. The total area of ​​the islands is 12,000 square kilometers and its population is 3,000. In 1833 the British Army took control of the group of islands and turned them into a British protectorate. However, Argentina has claimed over the years that the islands belong to it, because of their proximity to its shores. In 1982 a war broke out between Britain and Argentina over control of the islands. The war ended two months later with Britain&#39;s victory. In 2010, the struggle for control over the islands intensified after British companies began drilling in the area.

The mission was opened in Rishon Letzion. This will in effect cancel the role played by Mickey Ganor until the submarine incident exploded last year.

Ganor&#39;s role will be canceled until the affair explodes. (Photo: AP) New details about the internal investigation conducted by the Tisnekrop corporation on the submarine deal with Israel. Informed sources said that the internal investigation at Tysenkrup lasted many months, during which dozens of workers were questioned and scanned emails and relevant protocols. However, in Tysenkopf, the results of the investigation are very partial, since there has been no official contact with Ganor since the affair broke out due to a limitation related to Israeli law. But Ganor was not alone in the process. Former CEO of the shipyard Walter Freitag, who played a key role in the replacement of veteran representative Shaike Barkat in Mickey Ganor and since retiring, refused to cooperate with the internal investigation, but the companies asked Ganor The transfer of the funds did not cause any suspicion of irregularities at the time, and Tisnekrup has already handed over about 11 million euros to Ganor, who is suspected to have bribed senior officials to promote deals with Tysenkrup. The final investigation was transferred to the German and Israeli authorities. German authorities have not yet opened an investigation, and officially the German prosecutor has been conducting a preliminary examination for many months. It is also interesting that the Israeli authorities did not ask Tesenkoprop questions or request for additional materials. The internal investigation also revealed that when Ganor, accompanied by David Shimron, came to Tysenkrupp to negotiate his contract, he was able to change his wage structure so that the commission he would earn from the execution of futures contracts would increase in comparison to the brokerage fee. Betisenkrup claims that Shimron was then presented as Ganor&#39;s personal attorney and not as a party involved in the deal. In the internal investigation, no evidence was found of Barkat&#39;s version, according to which he was replaced by Ganor following the demand of elements in Israel. The company&#39;s internal documents noted only Barkat&#39;s age and the need for a younger representative to accompany long-term projects as a reason for the change. The sources added that officials in Tysenkrup expressed pessimism and skepticism about the realization of the deal due to the progress of the investigation in Israel. Tomorrow, the annual press conference of Tysenkrupp will be held in Essen. The merger will be with the Indian company Tata Steel, which will make it the second largest steel producer in Europe.

He is playing with fire on the backs of the residents of the Gaza Strip and at the expense of internal Palestinian reconciliation and the region as a whole. &quot;In a threat published by Mordechai YouTube, he added:&quot; It should be clear: for every Islamic Jihad response, Israel will respond with force and determination, To the Jihad, but also to Hamas. &quot;Mordechai appealed to the heads of the organization and said:&quot; We advise the Islamic Jihad leadership in Damascus to exercise caution and control matters. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad headquarters in Damascus and the leaders of the organization - Ramadan Shelah and Ziad Nahaleh - take matters quickly into your own hands, because you are the ones who will bear responsibility. &quot;'),(84,50,'&quot;Why do you read exactly the basis?&quot; Amir Kasher tried to understand the question. Thirty years ago, after his military profile fell, he served as a soldier in the Nahal brigade headquarters, a week at the base, a week at home. He kept a tent camp near the helipad in Gibor in the north of the country. &quot;The outskirts of Kiryat Shmona, right next to Beit Hillel,&quot; he asked to mark the location, &quot;a camp that was not built in any way as a defense, a kurkar surface with several tents, not even surrounded by a fence. The darkness, the darkness, the idea of ​​someone attacking, like aliens would land on Earth. &quot; On the night of November 25, 1987, Roni Almog, who had been stationed at the headquarters shortly before, was caught in the post, and Almog grabbed the post and probably a few minutes before the shift was over and he could return to the warm bed. A terrorist with a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a bullet-proof vest, in which case he would probably have been forgiven if he had skipped the &quot;Stop Password!&quot; Drill, but the guard chose a step that would never be forgotten. Yibril landed nearby with the help of Glashon, who killed Lieutenant Liron Panini on the way, arrived at the center of the encampment, and shot five soldiers, wounding ten, and was then liquidated by the quartermaster Gideon Bashari, who strove for the touch, that night will be remembered in the history of the IDF as the great omission. In an investigation conducted by Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, then head of the Personnel Directorate, he asked to mention only two people - Bashari, who killed the terrorist and Sergeant Alon Wolfin, a medic who ran to treat the wounded and was wounded. The rest remained framed in the Big Fashala group. Last week, a memorial ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the disaster was held near the memorial monument. Among the speakers was Yoram Rabovsky, a doctor of political science and communications, and Rabovsky was the worst casualty on the night of the gliders, and received four bullets, two of them in the head, and he still suffers from vision difficulties. For days, I was snatched, &quot;Ravovsky admitted. &quot;He&#39;s the only one I&#39;m angry at. There are at least four ranks above me who all decide that they are not to blame and catch this poor man, Roni Almog. They say: &#39;Yalla, we&#39;ll close the story there, and after that all the Nahal soldiers will be blamed.&#39; &quot;Where are the apologies, bereaved families who for 30 years have not heard that their soldiers were functioning properly? I did not want to tell Feld during the ceremony, because it was in the presence of the parents, but I looked at him with one naked eye. &quot; Maj. Gen. (res.) Peled responded immediately to the following: &quot;What came out of the night of the surfboards? Who harassed poor Roni Almog. But no one remembers that the commander of the division made a command note in the case, the commander of the Nahal Brigade was deposed, Captain was dismissed from the army, but everyone concentrated on Roni who fled and abandoned the life of his comrades. Why did you suggest? &quot;I was on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. One rose and said to Rabin: &#39;The defense minister, this is no less a market for the State of Israel than the Yom Kippur War.&#39; I told myself that they were crazy, lost their heads. I entered Rabin&#39;s office and announced: &#39;It&#39;s hysteria, I&#39;ll resign and you&#39;ll have peace.&#39; He got angry and said, &#39;Do not talk about it anymore.&#39; I am responsible and many of us do not understand the difference between responsibility and guilt. As commander in chief, everything that happens in command, for better or for worse, is my responsibility, but it still does not make me guilty. It&#39;s not a clear norm today to say, &#39;Guys, I take responsibility.&#39; I told Rabin: &#39;You want a big head, there&#39;s one.&#39; It was dangerous. Rabin was able to say that in order, and what would I say, that I did not mean to? &quot;Shoot, scream&quot; Stop &quot;The night of the gliders is a festering wound that they have been dealing with for 30 years, not only the harsh consequences, it is a story of fighting, responsibility and courage. And complicated by the escape of the guard. &quot;I was a soldier in the Nahal Brigade ten years later,&quot; says Peleg Netanel, Guy&#39;s brother, who was killed on the night of the surfboards. &quot;I heard the legacy of the battle and how the story was distorted. At least one class will know what happened, I always believed that the soldiers there did everything in their power, but it turned into the legends that they slept in the tent, and many people get confused with the night of the pitchforks. &quot; Roni Almog ran away, there&#39;s no argument about that. He was sentenced to a year and a half in prison and was released from the country. In the eyes of many of the leaders of the sector, he is the main culprit in the omission. &quot;Everyone asked what they wanted from the guardhouse, and I said: &#39;What is required of him,&#39;&quot; explains Major General (res.) Yoram Yair, then the division commander in whose section the incident took place. &quot;What is required of a soldier? Defend himself, the unit, the friends. The action might have endangered his life, but that&#39;s what it takes. One thing must be clear: Even if the battalion commander is not right and the brigade commander is not and the division commander, the only one who could have prevented the incident directly was the guard, and none of them had a way to fix it. Delaying the terrorist. &quot; Amir Kasher, then a daytime guard, is now serving as a guide and does not agree with the general&#39;s decision. &quot;It is ridiculous to say,&quot; Why is there a shag? &quot; If that&#39;s the case, you have to give him the minimal tools to defend, or make it clear that this is a situation that can happen. If there was a serious probability of penetration, then where was the fence around, the lights that would light up outside, and not just the guard post, people in the camp were as complacent every evening, Ronny became a great injustice, I guess no one knows how he would react in such a case. I did not stand in front of live fire, but there is a chance I would react like him. &quot; I asked for a psychological opinion from Dr. Ami Bronsky, who served for 16 years in the IDF mental health system. I wanted to know if a reaction like that of coral can not be natural. The desire to survive at all costs and fear. &quot;We are preparing fighters in a combat force in a systematic and deep way to a situation where they will be prepared to die for each other,&quot; Dr. Bronsky explained. &quot;When you take someone who was not built into the situation, you do not feel that his friends are the twin souls, like in Golani or in the Sayeret, he finds himself stuck somewhere. It is unrealistic for me to expect such a thing. The army has to ask itself whether people who do not do their jobs are screwed up or wrongly chosen or trained incorrectly. The attitude that the soldier is the problem is convenient, but suppose you are a father and your child remains a class, you can not say he is an idiot. You are asking why you did not notice why you did not protect him. &quot;The Magistrate&#39;s Court in Almog received a sentence of one and a half years in prison. He was a minority in the panel of judges, and claimed to his colleagues that the Haganah had to receive the maximum punishment: &quot;He betrayed his friends, betrayed trust,&quot; Givati ​​claims today. &quot;The army prepared him, gave him weapons and at night put him in a guard post. The minimum expected of a soldier to be alert, and if there is a risk, like a terrorist coming across from him, he should strive to touch even if it will cost his life. He is a coward, an egoist who has only taken care of himself. In his lawyers&#39; trial, too, they tried to prove that in the IDF it was a norm to run away, generals fled, and I saw dozens of Golani soldiers killed on Mount Hermon in order to rescue their comrades under fire. &quot; Not all of them are brave. &quot;I&#39;m not brave. In the first encounter and in all the bumps the eggs clank, you tremble, the mouth dries up, but the heroism is to recover. No one expected him to fight the terrorist, but to lay down the weapon, send some bullets. Do not do anything, run away? &quot;I told them, &#39;Here we have to see and be judged to judge him as hard as possible.&#39;&quot; Let&#39;s go in case Elazar Azaria, I ask you, the guard was sitting for a year and a half, Azaria identical? Azaria abandoned friends? On the contrary, he did over Duing and got a year and a half, so you compare him to that coward? Public and military justice systems disappoint me. Judges are revealed as compassionate and merciful until it hurts them. There is a lot of injustice. &quot;The smell of the gunpowder Maj. Gen. Amiram Levin, who was an investigating officer following the night of the gliders, holds a slightly different opinion:&quot; I do not know whether they are afraid of being tried, &quot;he said. &quot;Anyone who is not afraid is an idiot or a liar. The question is: do we give the fighters tools to overcome, and if they fail, how do they react? Is it the way to drill, learn lessons, or sacrifice the pheasant? They have not invented pills against fear yet. Try to give the fighters as much as possible to be prepared and skilled. Creating ethos and commitment to each other. &quot;You can identify who you can rely on?&quot; The studies say it&#39;s hard to predict who will be brave, there are times when someone was brave once, and the other way around, the fact that you see units that excel in combat and those who do not. The same people, the same tools, in one company they invested more. &quot; Yoram Rabovsky remembers nothing from that night. He was conscious when he was brought up to the helicopter that took him to the hospital in critical condition, but later it was a month and a half in a coma. When he awoke, nothing left of his mind in the battle. &quot;The brain seems to know what it does not want to remember, see things that do not have to,&quot; he said, &quot;The closest I could get emotionally was after five years of treatment. Rabovsky was a soldier in the Signal Corps company when the attack began. He managed to put on a vest, a flak jacket, and a skullcap, which certainly saved his life. For years he had occupied him with what had happened that night in the heart of the camp. &quot;I gathered all the material,&quot; he said. &quot;The next night of the Gliders was an interview by His Honor, Northern Command Chief Yossi Peled and Chief of Staff Dan Shomron. They said the soldiers were not trained. Shomron added &quot;second-class soldiers.&quot; You start with this burn. Of course, after two weeks, on page 14, on the side, it said that the soldiers were working properly, but who remembers? You lived with the drill and for years I was glad not to say I was wounded on the night of the surfboards. Do you know what the most irritable? The terrible feeling that I have been living with for 30 years, the question: Did I function? I do not remember. &quot;In Vilnai&#39;s report, the soldiers of the contact company were described as follows:&quot; Higher alertness and rapid response by these soldiers could have greeted the terrorist when he arrived at the company&#39;s surface ... The firing time in the company&#39;s field was very short and lethal, It should be emphasized that most of the soldiers who were injured were on their way to the personal equipment in order to organize and act, but some of the soldiers remained in the tents during the shooting and did not go outside. To this day, the soldiers feel that some of them have been hidden, while the quartermaster Gideon Bashari, who liquidated the terrorist, has become the hero of the day. &quot;I did not think they were incompetents,&quot; Vilnai said this week, &quot;We said we threw everything on the guard, so let it be clear: the guard is guilty, period, but at the same time the brigade commander stopped being promoted, three sirs and three sergeants The army, and each of them saw the army as a way of life, it was not a small thing, but those who were flying simply fled, and I told the chief of staff that they were not fit, otherwise they would have climbed the Golan Heights. The fact that the liaison company had a problem, it happens, we were in these situations. You are caught by surprise, &quot;The soldiers feel they have been erased.&quot; I put an emphasis on the army&#39;s code of ethics, how it is conducted, it&#39;s easy to say that we said that the soldiers are guilty, but when you examine the matter, the Nahal soldiers did not do anything. We thought they were wrong. The only one who paid a price was the guard, which happened on his shift. &quot; Bashari, the hero, refused to talk. In an interview he gave a few years ago to the Voice of Mevasar radio station, he said: &quot;It was about ten and 20. I sat in the tent, and my commander picked up the phone and told him there was an alert, but we did not understand exactly what was happening. I took the weapon and a double cartridge and ran in the direction. I saw guys lying wounded, some dead. I lay down not far from them. I was sure that the person was shooting on the other side of the fence. &quot;I had no choice but to shout to the wounded to return fire, and some replied, I did not recognize the source of the shooting, I decided to take the subject, and I got up to jump from lying to kneeling, and suddenly he came out to me and ran. At an automatic and four meters from me he fell dead. &quot; When asked why he did the bold act, Bishari told the interviewer: &quot;It&#39;s out of an education to help a friend in times of trouble. To run forward and try to save what is possible. &quot;The parents&#39; wound from the history books disappeared from the story of the difficult battle that took place in the camp, perhaps because of the embarrassment caused by a single terrorist.&quot; Jackie the deputy commander pursued him with the jeep until the terrorist threw a grenade at him. &quot;Daniel Miller, our sergeant, ran to take care of a friend who was wounded and was killed, so he is a systemic failure, where is their place?&quot; I meet the parents here and there, and they are already there. If they could only tell them the story, they had already despaired of receiving a positive signal or a signal of heroism, and they were kept away, saying, &#39;There was no heroism, it was a failure.&#39; &quot; Yohanan arrived last week for a memorial ceremony in the north. He too is carrying the events of the night, and not only because of the injury to his leg. On the Saturday before the disaster he spoke with Amira, the mother of his friend Guy Netanel, who was supposed to celebrate a birthday in those days. She asked him to save her son, but Guy was killed and for seven years it was hard for him to make eye contact with her. &quot;The mind could not contain it. These were feelings of guilt, &quot;he says,&quot; as one who was at the event, there is a sense that the part of the little soldier was not made public, and we were soldiers who agreed to sacrifice their lives and were somehow lost because of the army&#39;s lack of functioning and the flow of events. it was not&quot;. &quot;The vests were concentrated in the center of the camp, and as soon as the attack began, we wanted to take them, because that was what we were trained to do - to pick up a flak jacket and a helmet, but the terrorist managed to catch us by surprise. I do not know in those seconds whether there were 15 terrorists or one, and if you were 15, you would need more than a magazine, and then they&#39;d ask, &#39;Why did not you take the vests?&#39; &quot; I raised my head and he confused me, I did not understand what he was doing. It took a few seconds to catch up, and in the meantime the terrorist fired, threw grenades. I grabbed a 7.62 mm Kalashnikov ball and flew back, I tried to get up and the leg twisted, someone came and pulled me into the tent and saved me, because I might have stayed in the range of bullets I&#39;m talking to you and it pains me that some idiot, Managed to take down six brave soldiers, and I stand behind it, soldiers looking for contact, doing their utmost. &quot; Peleg, the brother of Guy Netanel, remembers how his father dragged the chief of staff to the Moked program on Channel One to apologize for the statement that the fighters were second class. &quot;No one ever wrote in the investigation that my brother&#39;s weapon was checked, From which ammunition was fired, &quot;Peleg says. &quot;I discovered this only recently. My brother strove to contact the terrorist and fired, and that closed what I believed in without a stamp. I knew the soldiers were clean, did the best. At the memorial service, I heard Yossi Peled and became angry. After the disaster the parents were close to him, fell into a honey trap, and over the years we realized that this was also his fault. He threw the responsibility into the camp. &quot;Peled still does not really clean the soldiers:&quot; Shomron came out with a miserable statement when he said, &#39;Second-class soldiers.&#39; &quot;In a difficult incident, with six dead, this is not a wise statement. I was sitting in the command, in the evening, and I said straight away, &quot;I was in the middle of the night, &#39;Friends, this is penetration,&#39; he asks me, &#39;why is this, intuition, something told me that it was real. Black lines on this short are angry soldiers. The bag fell on them and barely scratched the senior officers. Peleg Netanel prepared a fascinating film about intelligence that did not reach the fighters. Reports that were supposed to take all the forces out of indifference. &quot;Try to analyze what happened,&quot; Dr. Rabovsky asked. &quot;A terrorist infiltrates Israel&#39;s air defenses. You know he was sitting on the surfboard Israeli aircraft? A helicopter that did not receive a permit to open fire. There are the soldiers along the border who see everything that passes, up or down. I talked with them, they knew too and passed on. We are on the back line, sitting in the hero camp. All the units before us saw and no one transferred the information. I asked for the military inquiry and I received it marked with black lines, what is allowed to know and what is forbidden. The investigation did not say anything. And if you ask me, some of them are censored from political interests. &quot;For seven years, Rabovsky spent seven years dealing with psychological problems in order to get rid of the trauma of the night of the gliders, and said that for 25 years he did not talk to his comrades. He tells of a fighter who left the country because every time he moved his room north, he would panic. Talks about a nuclear daughter who whenever she hears a helicopter in the sky she gets stressed. In 2008, an appeals committee deliberated a request filed by one of the night fighters, who told about a treatment that began only 18 years after the incident. The petition reads: &quot;Since the incident, he has apparently suffered from depression and anxiety, difficult memories and feelings of helplessness. For years he blamed himself and was afraid to talk about the incident. For years after the incident, he did not know that he was severely handicapped. He is left uneducated, without a profession, without a livelihood and without a social life, and the burden of making a living rests with his wife and his brothers who help. In 1994, he was released from reserve duty for mental illness. Was hospitalized three times for anxiety attacks, later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred to psychiatric treatment. &quot;&quot; The incident was traumatic because of his character, &quot;Ravovsky said. &quot;They brought in those who survived and were not injured in the tent, boys and girls together, closed around, did not let go until the story passed. They did not share and in the morning they began to release names, who was killed and who was wounded. An IDF psychologist came to visit once and that&#39;s it, I&#39;m the only one who really took care of himself, because I&#39;m a 100 percent disabled IDF soldier, so there are advantages, I deserve treatment for free. &quot;That&#39;s how it is in the army, the simple soldier is erased from the stories of the generals who conquered, And the second, because of a mishap, landed in Lebanese territory, right next to the border Major General (res.) Peled remembers how only the day after the event was learned about the second surfboard, The commander, Yoram Yair, who commanded the division that dominated the sector and was reprimanded, remembers the end of the second surfer a little differently. I immediately started a chase and found him in some ditch, shot and hit. &quot; I asked Yair what about the families of the soldiers, whose nightgowns bag continues to weigh on them. He gave an example of another case so that I could understand the point. &quot;There was an incident at Givati&#39;s post, an abnormal disgrace,&quot; he said, &quot;two terrorists attacked, and the guys ran away from the post. I wrote that I want to tell the same mother that the problem is to relate to a daring fighter in the Givati ​​Brigade, the one sitting in the front post, as a child. And the one who attacked him was no older than him, maybe even younger, except that there was not a whole army behind him. The terrorist took weapons and grenades and decided to attack, and discovered that the IDF has no fighters in front of them, but rather children, for the mother is a child, and that&#39;s okay, but you can not claim &#39;what do you want from the children?'),(85,51,'A squad that threw improvised explosive devices on the tunnel road leading to Jerusalem from the direction of the village of Beit Jala in the past few weeks was stopped Thursday by IDF forces from the Etzion and Binyamin regional brigades, . The members of the cell were arrested in the village of Ramon and in the Deheishe and Elza refugee camps, on suspicion of having carried out the attack in an area located in the area of ​​the Etzion regional brigade. There were no casualties and no damage was done. Following this phenomenon, joint intelligence and operational activity began in order to locate the cell that had fled and split into several villages. As part of the arrests, the vehicles of the activists who were used for the offense were also confiscated. The activists confessed to carrying out the attacks, and indictments will be served against them. In the course of the night, IDF, Shin Bet security service, Border Police and Israel Police arrested seven wanted persons in the Judea and Samaria region, six of whom were arrested, suspected of involvement in popular terror activities and violent disturbances against civilians and security forces.'),(86,52,'A Hamas activist who infiltrated into Israel from the Gaza Strip at the end of September was arrested and about a month ago indicted, the newspaper said Thursday. The man, Ahmad &#39;Abid, 23, from the Saja&#39;iya neighborhood in Gaza City, joined the terrorist organization in 2013. He also participated in the digging of tunnels in his area of ​​residence and served as Hamas&#39; Harrison Force (border security). A report on the activity of Hamas&#39; tunnel network in the Gaza Strip - tunnels intended for attacks against Israel and tunnels intended for fighting IDF forces inside the Gaza Strip - revealed the terrorist activity of Hamas in the area of ​​tunnels to promote terrorist activity against the State of Israel On October 23, an indictment was submitted to the Be&#39;er Sheva District Court And on October 30, the IDF blew up a tunnel of terror that penetrated Israeli territory. The explosion killed 12 Islamic Jihad members, five of whom were held by Israel. The terrorist organization threatened to avenge Israel, and as a result, the level of alert on the Israeli side was raised, including placing Iron Dome batteries throughout the country. Yesterday, it was announced that the Ministry of Defense&#39;s crossings authority had foiled the smuggling of several tons of explosives on their way to the terror elements in Gaza. Recently, at the start of the laboratory, a truck arrived at the Kerem Shalom crossing, carrying a load of car oils, which aroused the suspicion of the security inspectors. Samples of the oils were transferred to the laboratory for testing, which identified the engine as innocent, but rather a dangerous substance intended for the manufacture of explosives in a very large quantity.'),(87,53,'US President Donald Trump revealed to the Russian government that Mossad and Sayeret Matkal were operating in Syrian territory against Da&#39;ash, former Mossad chief Danny Yatom, on Thursday in the program of Ayala Hasson in 103 FM, claimed that &quot; &quot;Today, we see that among our best friends there are those who are not reliable.&quot; Yatom says that &quot;if the publications are correct, this is a serious blow to Israel&#39;s security because this story is accompanied by many elements that could harm our security - The action by way of the location of the action, which Trump also discovered to the Russians. &quot;He claimed,&quot; These are things that the Russians are not necessarily! Attorney at them and this action will not be possible to repeat it again, that exposed the Israeli system. In addition, according to the reports, there was also a significant exposure of the source in Da&#39;ash, who passed on the initial information. There are too many elements that endanger the security of the State of Israel. &quot;He also noted that&quot; When State A transfers information to State B, State B can not transfer the information to State C, unless there is explicit approval. In this case, the United States was not given permission to transfer the information. Everything that happened here is a very big failure. &quot;A senior intelligence official explained that&quot; people who do not deal with intelligence do not understand how difficult it is to collect the fragments of information, so they think that this situation should be taken lightly. Anyone who understands this knows how much sweat and tears, at the risk of our forces, passed over intelligence bodies in order to process the information and obtain it. &quot;When asked if he was involved in a secret operation that was leaked, Yatom replied,&quot; I do not remember that such a thing happened. I remember cases in which we shared very intimate information with various parties after an action we carried out, but we never shared the information before the operation for fear of endangering our forces. Today we see that among our best friends there are those who are not reliable. After this leak, the relevant authorities in the State of Israel must follow the way in which the information passes and how it is handled, and if this happens, the information we transmit should be filtered. &quot;103FM: Itamar Zigelman');
