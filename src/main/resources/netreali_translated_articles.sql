The Central Election Commission ruled that he was not allowed to run because of a suspended sentence following conviction of embezzlement. \"We knew that this would happen, so we announced the boycott of the elections, and the process in which we are called to participate is not real elections, only Putin and the candidates he has chosen will participate in them,\" he said. The opposition leader called on the Russians not to vote for corruption and lies. Harpani said that the activities of the offices of his campaign team throughout Russia would now be devoted to boycotting the elections and to monitoring the voting percentages on March 18. Harpani said that support for Putin is exaggerated and artificial, and stems from misguided state media and an unfair system. He said that in fair elections he could beat Putin. Harpani arrived today for a visit to the Moscow Election Commission. \"If you do not let me run, you make a decision against millions who demand that Nabalani take part,\" Harpani said before the conference\'s decision. \"You are not robots, you are living and breathing beings, you are an independent body, once in your life you will do the right thing,\" he told the election committee. His supporters applauded him, but the commissioners were unmoved. \"This is compliance with the law,\" one of them said. \"You are not robots,\" Harpani told the committee (Photo: AP) Harpani has repeatedly denied that he acted against the law and said the case against him is political persecution. Harpani was jailed three times in the past, and this year he was charged with breaking the law after organizing rallies and public meetings throughout Russia.

The president said yesterday that Russian authorities should monitor the activities of several social networks during the presidential campaign next year and examine the extent of their involvement in Russian politics. Putin did not mention the names of the companies or expressed concern about the activity of local or foreign companies. \"We need to carefully examine how many companies operate on the Internet, in social networks, and how widely they are involved in political life in the country,\" Putin said at a meeting of Russian parliamentarians on Putin signed the law last month, allowing authorities to define foreign media as \"foreign agents,\" in response to what Moscow defines as an unacceptable pressure on the Russian media by the United States. \"We have to carefully examine how they operate and how they will act during the presidential elections,\" Putin said, adding that he would not be required to provide details about their activities, such as sources of funding (Photo: AFP) Russia has already defined Radio Free Europe and Voice of America, both US-backed organizations as foreign agents, and polls show that Putin, 65, who leads Russia in 2000, is likely to win easily in the presidential election in March 2018.

Security sources said Tuesday. This is the highest number of executions in a single day in Egypt since Abd al-Fatah al-Sisi took power in 2014. The security sources reported that the executions took place early in the morning in two prisons in the northern part of the Arab state. It was also reported that the death penalty was imposed by a military court and that Interior Ministry officials executed the executions at the same time in Burj al-Arab and Wadi al-Natatron prisons. (Photo: Reuters) (Photo: Reuters) Most of the executed Islamist men are from the Sinai region. They were accused of \"joining terrorist organizations and participating in planning, planning and assisting the killing of a number of military and police personnel in the Sinai,\" the sources said. In recent years, the Islamic State (Da\'ash) branch in the Sinai has carried out a series of attacks against the Egyptian security forces in northern Sinai, and in the last year even increased its targets and also harmed Christians and other citizens. Only last month more than 300 people were killed in a mosque attack in Sinai. This was the most deadly attack in the history of modern Egypt, and it was attributed to Da\'ash even though the Sunni terrorist organization did not take responsibility for it.

But she lost her seven-year-old son who had died in a DP camp in the Arab state. In the past few days, temperatures have been dropping, and tens of thousands of Syrian citizens forced to leave their homes in war-torn Syria are spending another winter in plastic tents or abandoned buildings. In the absence of heating, blankets, warm clothing or access to proper medical care, even cold can simply be fatal. \"My son died because of the cold,\" said 35-year-old Yabda Khadijah, who looks exhausted and aching - a week after her son Abdel-Ilah died. After fleeing the Da\'as stronghold of al-Raqqa, Khadijah\'s family turned north and traveled 55 kilometers to the Ein Issa DP camp.

Thousands of tents, no more than 17,000 people, found refuge in the Ein Issa camp, where 2,550 tents were erected, which are not really weatherproof. Most of the residents in the DP camp were filled with Da\'ash attacks in a-Raqqa and Dir a-Zour district. Many of their homes were scattered, their towns and villages turned into rubble without electricity and running water. Back home is not an option at all. According to the United Nations, which provides aid to the Syrian refugee camp, there is no new clinic to treat the growing population of the area, with more than half of the camp residents claiming that their tents need repair or maintenance to protect them from the cold.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Lima to protest the amnesty to Fujimori and confronted the security forces, who used tear gas to disperse them. More interesting news from the world On the Facebook page of the Foreign Desk, Kozynski published his announcement on Christmas Eve. He wrote that he had decided to release former President Fujimori for \"humanitarian reasons\" and cited doctors who had determined that the imprisoned leader had incurable problems. \"I am convinced that those who consider themselves Democrats can not allow Alberto Fujimori to die in prison, justice is not revenge, all pardons are controversial, there are a large number of Peruvians opposed to amnesty,\" Kuczynski said in his statement. \"My message is complex and very difficult, but this is my decision, I can not be the president only of the people who voted for me, I have to be the president of all the Peruvians.\" Pujimori\'s son chirped the moment when his father received the news of the amnesty. December 25, 2017 Fujimori, 79, who ruled Peru from 1990 to 2000, is considered a controversial figure in Peru. There are quite a few Peruvians who praise him for defeating the Maoist guerilla movement \"The Glowing Path,\" while others detest him for human rights violations committed under his government. Human rights organizations were quick to condemn the pardon received by the President of Peru. The daughter of the dictator worked to free her father from prison The daughter of former tyrant Keiko Fujimori lost in the last presidential election to Kuchinsky in a tight race, and her party was drafted in Congress. This month, Keiko\'s party tried to oust Kuchinsky because of his business connections with the Brazilian company Odebrecht, Latin America\'s largest contractor, at the center of a major corruption scandal. But the Peruvian president survived the impeachment proceedings against him last Thursday. Fujimori, the prisoner, applied for a medical pardon more than a year ago on the grounds that his health was deteriorating. He wrote on his Twitter that he had a heart rhythm disorder in which he had been hospitalized several times in the last year. Last night he remained in the clinic where he was brought from prison after suffering from low blood pressure. Would have remained in prison until the age of 93 if he had not been pardoned. Alberto Fujimori (Photo: AP) Keiko Fujimori and one of her brother Kenji visited their father yesterday at the clinic. Then the brother on Twitter tweeted that his father would stay in hospital for a few more days. Fujimori\'s supporters: \"He is a brave man, the best Peruvian president of all time\" Fujimori\'s supporters gathered outside the Lima clinic to celebrate the pardon granted to him. \"He is a brave man, the best Peruvian president of all time,\" Juana Lopez said. Several dozen opponents of Fujimori demonstrated not far from the presidential palace in Lima. Some of them shouted \"Kuchinsky traitor\" and \"Fujimori murderer\" and held posters bearing pictures of people murdered during Fujimori\'s reign. Jose Miguel Villanaso, director of Human Rights Watch in Latin America, wrote on his Twitter that the pardon for Fujimori was \"vulgar political negotiations in exchange for Kuchinsky\'s survival In power. \"Amnesty International demanded that Kochinsky clarify the doubts that arose because of the lack of transparency in the process of amnesty of the former tyrant. Eduardo Darguent, a professor of political science at a Catholic university in Peru, predicts that the Peruvian president\'s decision will turn out to be \"his biggest mistake.\" He said the pardon was a \"mockery\" of the people who voted for Kuchinsky in the second round of the election when he ran against Keiko Fujimori. According to Peruvian law, a person convicted of murder or kidnapping can not receive presidential pardons. The exception is a state of terminal illness. Three previous Fujimori requests for medical pardon since 2013 were rejected after doctors claimed he was not suffering from incurable problems or severe mental instability. (Photo: EPA) In a statement issued by Kuchinsky, it was reported that a medical committee had evaluated Fujimori and determined that he was suffering from an advanced, degenerative and incurable disease and that the prison conditions posed a danger to his life, health and well-being. Fujimori was first convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 25 years in prison at the age of 25, including an eight-year-old boy, during his tenure as president of Peru. He was convicted four more times - the most serious conviction concerned the existence of liquidation units financed by public funds and murdering a civilian Fujimori, former president of the university and a lecturer in mathematics, has been accused of involvement in the guerrilla organization \"The Bright Path\" (Photo: EPA) (photo: AFP) (Photo: AFP) Was considered a political outsider when he defeated Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru in 1990. Peru suffered from high inflation and insurgent violence and soon rebuilt the country\'s economy with a massive privatization of state-owned industries, defeating the Maoist guerillas, But gained wide public support. Fujimori\'s presidency collapsed as quickly as he came to power. After closing the congress and continuing for a third term without elections, Fujimori fled the country in 2000 after videos leaked to the media showed his intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, bribing lawmakers. Fujimori moved to Japan, the country of his parents\' birth, and sent a letter of resignation via a fax machine. Five years later he stunned his supporters and enemies when he flew to neighboring Chile, where he was arrested and extradited to Peru. Fujimori\'s goal was to run for president again in 2006, but instead he was tried and convicted of abuse of power. Did you find a mistake in the article?

However, the students decided that they were fed up with the situation and began protesting. One morning, instead of going to classrooms in dark blue uniforms, a group of students arrived in white T-shirts and demanded \"to put an end to discrimination.\" In a public school in the northern Tunisian city of Bizerte, as well as in most of the North African high schools, students must sign a school law stipulating that wearing a uniform applies to girls only. \"Injustice\". In September, school inspectors made it clear to students in their last year that they had not obeyed the dress code that if they did not wear the uniform, they would be sent home. Ironically, the warning to the students was given during a philosophy lesson on the human body. The boys also joined the protests. \"The unfairness\" of the school authorities led the students to turn to the social networks to express their feelings and protest. She said the schoolgirls agreed to take a collective step the next day and \"demand that this discrimination stop.\" Dozens of students dressed up in protest and arrived at the school in white shirts. Some boys dressed in the same way out of solidarity for their classmates. How did the school authorities react? They just said nothing. From that moment on, a protest campaign was launched under the slogan \"I will not wear it.\" The campaign was born after years of conflict between high school students and Tunisian education authorities. In primary schools, the obligation to wear uniform applies to all students, but the Tunisian girls were furious that in high school this obligation applies only to girls, while the boys are exempt from it. Girls who, over the years, did not arrive in uniform to school were expelled home or their parents summoned for a conversation. (Photo: AFP) Monia Ben Gemayeh, head of the Tunisian Women\'s Democratic Union, an independent feminist organization, said the obligation to wear the blue uniform is a \"terrible message\" because it implies that young girls\' bodies will have an impact on the boys they study. She said it was a complete deviation, especially after the new constitution of 2014 states that men and women are equal. \"The supervisor said I can not wear tights without a tunic.\" The high school students who launched the protest campaign, girls and boys, also oppose what they see as greater \"hypocrisy.\" \"They are digging in the school that men and women are equal, but in practice it is not what happens,\" said Aadam Garci, 17. The blue uniform was designed to blur social inequality among students. \"If it really is meant to hide differences between rich and poor, then the boys should wear the uniform,\" said the high school girl with a smile. Her friend Farah bin Juma\'a said that forcing girls to wear blue uniforms while their bodies were changing was not a trivial matter. \"Our supervisor told me that I can not wear tight pants without a tunic (a broad, long, feminine shirt that reaches up to my thighs and is worn over my pants or skirt) because I am \'shapely,\' and another supervisor told us, \'That bothers the male teachers, Ma\'a. The whole uniform outfit causes great embarrassment to the authorities in Tunisia, the pioneer of the \"Arab Spring\" revolutions. A senior official in the country\'s education system admitted that this is a sensitive issue, although his country is considered a leader in the field of women\'s rights in North Africa and the Middle East. Ben Gemayeh of the Association of Democratic Women in Tunisia said that if the official position is that equality between men and women is an asset, many parts of Tunisian society will remain conservative and \"resist.\" \"This is a revolutionary generation, open to the world\" In the yard of another school in the city of Bizert, the Habim High School, equality is a hot topic for students to discuss. Of the 15 boys asked about the subject, only one - Nader - spoke in favor of the traditional position. \"Girls must cover their body shape,\" he said. \"That\'s how we were raised, it\'s our mentality, and it has to stay that way.\" The other boys supported the protest campaign led by the high school students. One senator tried to argue with a supervisor who wanted to enforce the school dress code. \"But ma\'am,\" he told her, \"what if the law is wrong?\" The supervisor thought for a moment and muttered: \"For me, it\'s not fair, it\'s the rules. The head of the Tolgawi School admitted that the supervisor\'s position would not change the attitude of the students who lived in the country\'s 2011 revolution, during which a 23-year dictatorship was overthrown and replaced with rights and freedom of expression. \"This is a revolutionary generation, open to the world, and when you try to impose something on them it does not work,\" he said. Ben Gemaya shares his words. \"These young people are much more aware of their rights, they have grown up with freedom of expression,\" she said. \"This is a revolutionary generation, and it\'s amazing.\" The first revolution in the Arab Spring brought freedom of speech and rights to women (Photo: Reuters) (Photo: Reuters) For dialogue with the regional education inspector in Bizerte, Nabil Samadhi, dialogue is the solution. \"It is time to address this issue with a national dialogue,\" he said, adding that \"this unrest is effective, not only in public high school, but in most institutions in Bizerte and some high schools across the country,\" he said. Meanwhile, Siwar Taburbi, Farah bin Gamma and other girls still come to school without uniform, \"We are not doing this just for us,\" said Ben Gamma. \"Next year we will not be here.

But in the new year the celebration could end. The New York City Municipality promised to fight the phenomenon of electric bicycles, which are popular with environmental activists and are popular among low-wage workers, especially poor immigrants. Many drivers and pedestrians think that electric bicycles are a threat. Under the municipal law, electric bicycles are allowed to be sold and sold, but riding on the street can lead to fines of up to $ 500. Mayor de Bellazio announced in the fall that in 2018 businesses whose employees use electric bikes could receive a $ 100 fine if employees were detained and $ 200 for another offense. \"It\'s illegal to use the streets on an electric bicycle, and those at the top of the food chain need to be responsible,\" said city spokesman Austin Finan. \"Instead of dealing only with the riders, we deal with the stores that look away and leave their employees to deal with the fine.\" The new policy of New York is proof that for many New Yorkers this is a harmful phenomenon. Many residents say that electric bikes, which look like ordinary bikes but can reach 30 kilometers per hour or more, came from nowhere at high speed and almost hit them on the street (Photo: AP) For Clemente Martinez, this is bad news. That people like me depend on them, \"says Martinez, 44, who came from Mexico to the United States nearly 15 years ago and has since worked mainly on missions. Three years ago, she bought electric bicycles. \"We use them as something that helps us work and support our families,\" she says. Du Li, who in his doctoral dissertation studies the life of the Apostles in New York, says the electric bicycle has made a huge difference for the shlichim in the city. Many of the apostles are middle-aged or older, hourly wage workers and many distances away under time pressure. \"They can not do their job without an electric bicycle,\" he said. Transportation activists argue that New York\'s struggle with the phenomenon is illogical, for environmental or safety reasons - while faster and heavier motorbikes continue to be legal, and a business using a scooter for shipments needs an insurance certificate. They are demanding that the municipality publish data showing whether the electric bicycle poses an exceptional safety risk compared with other vehicles. The Federal Law refers to electric bikes that travel at 30 kilometers per hour or less as regular bicycles, and New York law does not allow them to be registered in motorized circuits, and nearly one thousand electric bicycles have been confiscated by the police in the past year, 2016. New York electric bikes can cost thousands of dollars, such as scooters, a regular bike that gets \"upgraded\" and electricized for less than $ 500. Elizabeth Gorden, a lawyer at Make the Road New York, said the restaurants are already expecting Of the shlichim who will buy electric bicycles for work They are, \"she says,\" We think that even if the policy is to get to restaurants, it will harm the workers. \"Did you find a mistake in the article?'),(7,7,'X Go to underground passage: Moscow accident Close Send to a friend Your friend\'s email address Your name Your email address Subject Enter the code shown New image Your video was sent to your friend Close Embed your video Embed code: Horrible accident in Russian capital: At least Five people were killed and 15 injured when a bus raced Monday into a passageway leading to a subway in Moscow.

To choose between football, school or hard work in the fields, Father Salah Gali said the family would leave the decision to Allah The problem was that to succeed Salah had to leave the north and travel to Cairo, and when he did not get into the huge clubs, he tried his luck at the modest Muqawalun club in the capital suburbs, and the boy spent three hours on his way to practice. \"I would leave the house very early and return late at night,\" Salah said recently in an interview. \"I went on five buses every day just to get training.\" There were also days when young Salah stayed in the dressing room so that he would not have to go through the exhausting journey back in the evening: \"We had a game in the Cairo Youth League,\" Saad Al- Who was Salah\'s coach. \"We won 0-4, but he did not stop missing and finally he cried bitterly. \"The mental load on Salah was heavy, a small, talented player whose father had destined him for greatness, but something about talent did not ripen.\" He came to me and told me that one of the coaches did not stop on him , That he can not stand it anymore, \"said the player\'s father. \"That was when the big groups in Egypt were already interested. I told him: \'You stay here and prove to that coach that you are the most important player in the team. You will not stay in Egypt, you will come to Europe. \'\"The professionals understood like the father that there was a business here with another talent: the speed of a 100 meter runner, a superior technique and hard work, but at the same time an overly sensitive young man. , Egypt stunned South Africa\'s hostess in a dramatic game, but Salah shut himself up in his hotel room and ended in tears, but he did not forgive himself for the many missed chances. The invitation from Switzerland Salah flourished on the days when the land in Egypt was shaking in January 2011. The huge demonstrations in Cairo\'s Tahrir Square, which ended the long-term rule of President Hosni Mubarak, began on February 1, 2012. On February 1, 2012, a particularly charged game was held in Port Said between Al-Masri and Al-Ahli groups, Killing 74 fans and injuring more than a thousand The football star, Mohammed Abu-Trika, announced his retirement and even refused to shake hands with Mohammed Hussein Tantawi , Who was then serving as head of state. It was clear that Salah, a young man of 19, must find his place outside the crumbling Egypt. Fortunately for him, he was under advanced European surveillance. P.S. Basel is not considered a top-level group on the continent, but it is a club that has an advanced talent discovery department and an academy for the development of young footballers. Salah\'s name was already on the hunters\' books of the Swiss group. Club members took advantage of the fact that the young Egyptian team had become impotent because of the Port Said disaster and sought rivalry in preparation for the London Olympics in the summer of 2012. Basel invited the Egyptians to a friendly game. Salah was shining that day in national uniform. He entered as a substitute in the second half, scoring a pair and helped his team win 3-4. On the descent from the lawn, the Swiss management stopped him and suggested that he stay in order to get an impression of the place. The surprising date ended with the player buying from his Egyptian team for 1.5 million euros. In the first season of Salah in Basel the team won the championship, and he himself was chosen player of the season. In the prestigious ceremony, the first clash took place between the conservatism of Islam and the glamorous life of Europe. The prize\'s host, in her innocence, gave Salah the best player\'s trophy, but also added a kiss on the cheek, as is customary. In Egypt they did not approve of the gesture. How did Salah allow a stranger to approach him so intimately? The player, who has since learned to skip over mines, decided to answer. In an interview with Egyptian television he shot: \"They destroyed my joy. They forgot about the prize and concentrated on the woman who kissed me. The photographs show how embarrassed I am, and God knows I did not want that. In Switzerland, wherever I go, cheering me and only in my country are they criticizing me. \"The matter was quickly forgotten, because Salah continued to shine on the lawn, and his ability caused quite a few clubs to start watching games in the Swiss league to see what was happening with Messi, \"If Muhammad had scored more goals, he would not have been here or would not have come here at all,\" said his coach in Basel, Murat Yakin. \"If he was more accurate against the goal, he would have added another zero,\" continued club president Bernard Hassler, but the two also understood that the jewelry would not stay too long in their possession. To sell at an expensive price and immediately move on to the next project, while Liverpool was at the top of the line, but the price demanded by the Swiss - £ 11m - delayed it. For six months they debated whether to complete the deal. Follow the ability, agree with the President of Basel with a handshake and prepare to close the player\'s salary terms. Only then, in January 2014, did a surprising phone call from Switzerland come, with a message that Salah had decided to move to Chelsea, the rich club from London. Nothing helped. The agent of the player did not answer calls from Liverpool people who tried to change the decision. Salah later said he was convinced to come to Chelsea because of a phone call from coach Jose Mourinho, who asked him personally to join. A kick from Chelsea Mourinho is a football genius. There will be few who will question this assertion. There is hardly a group in which he trained and did not leave prestigious titles. This is a championship contractor with receipts. Only those who accept the Portuguese know that soccer will be more effective than happy, and in their teams there is not much patience for experimenting with young footballers. Either prove yourself on the grass, or come back in a few years when you\'re ripe for food. \"Salah has the potential to be an amazing player,\" he said at the time, \"but he comes from a background different from that of the rest of the team, he played in Switzerland and the Egyptian team and has to adapt to the environment.\" Salah had a hard time adjusting. The physicality of British football is different from any other league. And in Chelsea, a group of millionaires belonging to the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, there is a bunch of stars from all the continents that are many in their starting lineup. The player had another obstacle before he got on the grass. Under Egyptian law, he was supposed to return home to serve in the army, a service period of one to three years. Escape from duty means that he will no longer be able to return to his homeland. But a meeting between the team\'s director and Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahleb solved the problem - it was decided that Salah would be more useful to the Egyptian people as a soccer player than as a fighter. But despite the easing of conditions and the quiet head, Salah received very few opportunities to show his abilities. He sat a lot on the bench, to the disappointment of the millions of Egyptians who held his fingers in the house. \"It would be good for him to rekindle his career in the Spanish league,\" Ahmed Hamdi wrote in the Egyptian daily Al-Ahram. \"The style will suit him better. Where there is a technique and less muscle. \"Only Chelsea did not really care about the wishes of the Egyptian actor and commentators, who have already moved on to the next candidate, eyeing the Italian star of Fiorentina, Juan Quodrado, and offering a deal in which Salah will arrive in Florence and Quadrado will do the opposite. Salah was worried about the challenge he faced in England, and he was already used to life in London, and Chelsea was a big club with aspirations against Fiorentina, a lower-ranked team with modest intentions. The father told his son that we had to wait for the right opportunity to break through, and by then it was better The player signed in Fiorentina and asked to put on his shirt with the number 74 on his back, in memory of the victims of the game disaster at Port Said, and he had scored a goal in the second game in Florence, and from then on it was impossible to stop him. Seventeen days after he signed up with her, the number of her Facebook followers grew from 955,000 to 1.24 million, 60% of whom were from Cairo, who wanted to publish updates in Arabic so as not to lose their new followers. Florence was mad at the performance of the Egyptian magician. \"We knew what Salah\'s abilities were, but we did not expect him to have such a rapid impact on Italian football,\" said coach Vincenzo Montella, \"maybe Messi is faster than he is with the ball in his feet.\" In Italy there were those who compared Salah to the Argentine star, \"No one is laughing now at the comparison with Messi. It\'s hard to remember the history of the players\' transfer market in such a brilliant deal. \"Fiorentina wanted to leave Salah at any price, trying to seduce him with a huge financial offer on her scale:\" I tell our fans that the club has made a crazy offer to Salah, \"said Vincenzo Gorini Fiorentina management. \"If only every player, and not just Salah, would refuse such a proposal, then it would be better if he did not stay with us.\" Only Salah Salah Ghali wanted Muhammad to be listed next to titles and trophies, so the next stop was Rome, which first sought to reassure the Jewish community in the city and made it clear that Salah respected her and not West\'s politics, like when he arrived in Tel Aviv in Basel, also proved to be brilliant, and Salah\'s coach in Rome, Luciano Spalletti, admitted that he had never trained a player so well, and Salah was again chosen as the player of the season. The tail between the legs was ready to return to the British island - this time at the front door - the Egyptian star, apparently, bore a deep scar from that failure in Chelsea , The fact that many in the homeland football called it \"flop\". When he scored for Fiorentina against Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League, he was overly celebrated in his own terms - stripped off a shirt and ran madly to celebrate with the fans. \"He wanted to prove to the Englishmen what he could do,\" said a-Sayed, Salah\'s coach on Egypt\'s young team, who did not think twice before pulling out the checkbook, when she debated whether to pay £ 11 million. Blinking £ 37m - an all-time high for Chelsea - Chelsea are London, Kings Road, caviar and champagne in the viewing rooms at Stamford Bridge, Liverpool is still the heat and romance of football. The working class Two years ago, she joined the colorful German coach Jurgen Klop, who remembered Salah from the days when he spoke Switzerland and met him as coach of Dortmund, the previous team. He said his first reaction after meeting with him in that game was short: \"WHAT THE FUCK\". Even before he could ask his men to bring the Egyptian to Germany, it turned out that Salah was already closed in Chelsea. Salah corresponds to the energetic style of Clop in Liverpool. Fast, technical and offensive. \"If he played better in Chelsea, he probably was not with us,\" the German coach admitted, \"but then he was a boy, today it\'s a man.\" Salah speaks fluent English. He has a shy smile and a mane of curls that has become his trademark, but no gimmick conceals the enormous talent. Since arriving at Anfield, he has not stopped bombing. 20 goals in all competitions, King of the English League gates himself. \"He is the best player in the team this season,\" said Steven Gerard, Liverpool\'s legendary past star and one of the club\'s top players, who also scored in the league game against Chelsea, the club that rejected him. They thought that he had asked not to hurt his former friends, but later it turned out that it was because of the attack on the mosque in El Arish, in which more than 300 Egyptians were killed. When he played in Rome, he met with President al-Sisi and contributed $ 269,000 to the fund for the revival of the state, and since then he has also contributed to the hospital in the city of Sivan, \"He returns to the village where he is allowed, takes pictures with everyone, always modest.\" Four years ago, Salah married Maggie at a big wedding in the village. He invited the residents to participate in the celebration. Thousands arrived, and all the famous singers did not forget to honor him. Since then, a daughter has been born, Mecca, after the holy city of Islam. A few days after the birth, Salah changed the spelling of her name, especially so that the English would not get confused with Mecca Bingo, a company that runs dozens of gambling houses throughout the country, and over the years has maintained a clean image, as befits a national symbol. When he was asked to sell cars and hair products, he refused to help the Egyptian Tourism Ministry and led a campaign against violence against women in the country where he became an icon. The world for the first time since 1990. This year, on October 8, could not 94 minutes, the last seconds of extra time in the game against Congo, the scoreboard was scored 1-1, and Salah, the national hero, was on the penalty spot if he brought Egypt to play in Russia this summer. But Salah kept up the wonderful story he wrote when he set it up and made it 1 - 2. The final whistle brought millions to the celebrations in the streets, and even Brazilian Fela, the greatest player of all time, , Rushed to send a greeting to the new superstar. \"Mohammed Salah, this was an outstanding year for you. keep doing what you are doing. Looking forward to seeing you next year on the biggest stage of all, the World Cup. \"Salah was not yet born the last time Egypt played in the World Cup, but it is clear in the country today who is the greatest player in its history. He is only 25 years old.\" When we qualified for the World Cup in 1990, Said Hazem Imam, who played 87 games in national uniform. \"Now Salah is the sole leader.\" One of the wealthiest people in the country wanted to repay Salah for the happiness he had brought to the people and wanted to buy a luxurious villa for him, but the actor recommended that he donate the money to the village where he grew up. \"Muhammad Salah Vocational High School,\" as did the youth center in his village. There was already someone who declared \"Salah to the presidency,\" and the actor himself began to feel the power he had accumulated, and was not afraid to ask President al-Sisi to take into account the soccer player Abu-Trika, whom he has admired since childhood. Morsi, who is also well aware of the Salahmania, is the most popular player in the world, with over six million of his followers, compared to the official account of the group, on Twitter, counting more than 3.6 million fans, while Salah was sold to Swiss Basel five and a half years ago Was 1.5 million euros, the price of which rose to 37 million pounds this summer. The prices and recent performances probably helped to double the share price. Egyptian coach Hector Cooper confirmed that European champions Real Madrid are interested in the star, and with them the money is much bigger. Not long ago, when he was in the middle of the wonderful dream, Salah said in an interview with the British press: \"For an Egyptian guy, from my background, entering a world of professional football proves that nothing is impossible.\" In the days when Messi is an experienced 30-year-old player, Cristiano Ronaldo is no longer a child but a footballer A 32-year-old teenager, we may be watching the heir to the throne of the world football elite, a prince who grew up here just across the border.'),(27,27,'An Italian paramedic killed at least three patients and perhaps even 50, in order to sell funeral services to their families.

Another possible reason is that Park was blamed for the collapse of a tunnel in October, according to Asahi, which killed about 200 people. North Korea strongly denied this report.
